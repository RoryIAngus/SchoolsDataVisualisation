## 01 - Average government primary school class sizes by year (1997, 2004-2018)
Link: https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/average-government-primary-school-class-sizes-by-year
The class size audit is conducted in all NSW government primary, infant and central (primary grades only) schools in March each year.

Notes:

Class size audits were not conducted in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Data for 2002 and 2003 are available on request.

Students attending schools for specific purposes (SSPs), students in support classes in regular schools and distance education students are excluded from average class size calculations.

The average class size for each year level is calculated from regular and multi-age classes that contain a student from that year level. This can result in a lower K-6 average class size than any individual year level.

From 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.

Data from earlier years is not replaced in the Class Size fact sheet. Schools change size. Historical data displays the data that was correct in that year.

Refer to the individual publication for further information and policy context.

## 02 - Multi-age or composite classes in NSW government schools (2014-2018)
Link: https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/multi-age-or-composite-classes-in-nsw-government-schools

Multi-age classes are made up of students drawn from different year levels. They may be established because of the uneven pattern of enrolment in the school, because of the small size of the school or where it’s considered that mixing students of different ages is academically and socially advantageous.

Date notes:

Multi-age classes are often designed to match the organisation of the syllabus, which is based on ‘stages’ running over two years.

From 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.

Historical data displays the data that was correct in that year.

Refer to the individual publication for further information and policy context.

## 03 - Master dataset: NSW government school locations and student enrolment numbers
Link: https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/027493b2-33ad-3f5b-8ed9-37cdca2b8650

The master dataset contains comprehensive information for all government schools in NSW. Data items include school locations, latitude and longitude coordinates, school type, student enrolment numbers, electorate information, contact details and more.

This dataset is publicly available through the Data NSW website, and is used to support the School Finder tool.

Data Notes:

Student enrolment numbers are based on the census of government school students undertaken on the first Friday of August.

School information, such as addresses and contact details, are updated regularly as required, and are the most current source of information.

Data is suppressed for indigenous and LBOTE percentages where student numbers are equal to, or less than five.

NSSC out of scope schools will not have an enrolment figure.

NSSC and LBOTE figures are updated annually in December.

ICSEA values are updated every April with the previous year's ICSEA values. The master dataset is currently displaying 2016 figures. Small schools, SSPs and Senior Secondary schools do not have their ICSEA values published by ACARA.

Following the introduction of part-time study in secondary schools in 1993, student enrolments are generally reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE). The FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.

Norfolk Island Central School (NICS) is not a NSW government school. NICS is operated by the Australian government. The NSW Department of Education provides school education services under an agreement with the Australian government.
