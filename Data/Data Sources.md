## 01 - Average government primary school class sizes by year (1997, 2004-2018)
Link: https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/average-government-primary-school-class-sizes-by-year
The class size audit is conducted in all NSW government primary, infant and central (primary grades only) schools in March each year.

Notes:

Class size audits were not conducted in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Data for 2002 and 2003 are available on request.

Students attending schools for specific purposes (SSPs), students in support classes in regular schools and distance education students are excluded from average class size calculations.

The average class size for each year level is calculated from regular and multi-age classes that contain a student from that year level. This can result in a lower K-6 average class size than any individual year level.

From 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.

Data from earlier years is not replaced in the Class Size fact sheet. Schools change size. Historical data displays the data that was correct in that year.

Refer to the individual publication for further information and policy context.

## 02 - Multi-age or composite classes in NSW government schools (2014-2018)
Link: https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/multi-age-or-composite-classes-in-nsw-government-schools

Multi-age classes are made up of students drawn from different year levels. They may be established because of the uneven pattern of enrolment in the school, because of the small size of the school or where it’s considered that mixing students of different ages is academically and socially advantageous.

Date notes:

Multi-age classes are often designed to match the organisation of the syllabus, which is based on ‘stages’ running over two years.

From 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.

Historical data displays the data that was correct in that year.

Refer to the individual publication for further information and policy context.
